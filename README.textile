h2. About

I needed a solid base to build my own rails projects from. Since integrating all these disparate pieces isn't the easiest thing in the world, I decided to release this sample site in the hope that it would save you some time as well.

The demo application is designed to provide a solid, generic skeleton to base your next rails project on, and includes everything you'll need to dive straight in and get started.

h2. Demo Site

You can try out a live demo of the project at "railskitchensink.com":http://railskitchensink.com/. The database will be automatically re-generated every hour, so don't be surprised if any changes disappear.

h2. License

This project is distributed under the "MIT License":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_license. See the "License.txt":http://recursive-design.com/code/p/rails-kitchen-sink/source/tree/master/LICENSE.txt file for details.

h2. Installation

To get started, first download the source via git

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://recursive-design.com/rails-kitchen-sink.git
$ cd rails-kitchen-sink
{% endhighlight %}

Next, install the requisite gems :

{% highlight bash %}
$ bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Set up the database :

{% highlight bash %}
$ rake db:setup
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, run the local development server to try it out :

{% highlight bash %}
$ rails s
{% endhighlight %}

The demo application should now be available at "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/.

h2. What's Included?

I've tried to create a sensible base to start build your Rails 3 applications off of, with all the packages I generally use pre-integrated. _Rails Kitchen Sink_ currently combines :

* "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise authentication.
* "CanCan":http://github.com/ryanb/cancan authorization.
* "HAML":http://haml-lang.com/ templates.
* "CoffeeScript":http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ support.
* "metric_fu":http://metric-fu.rubyforge.org/ reports.
* Full "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ test suite.
* "Spork":http://github.com/timcharper/spork DRb server.
* "960":http://960.gs/ CSS grid system.
* "Jammit":http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/ asset packaging.
* "Formtastic":http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic forms.

h2. Testing

_Rails Kitchen Sink_ comes pre-configured for "Spork":http://github.com/timcharper/spork and "autotest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/#rsn support. I generally work by running _spork_ in one terminal :

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd rails-kitchen-sink
$ spork
Using RSpec
Loading Spork.prefork block...
Spork is ready and listening on 8989!
{% endhighlight %}

... and running _autotest_ in another :

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd rails-kitchen-sink
$ autotest
........................................................................................

Finished in 29.27 seconds
88 examples, 0 failures
{% endhighlight %}

Autotest will run the test suite automatically whenever you save changes, and if you're working on OSX, it will provide "Growl":http://growl.info/ feedback every time the test suite is run :

h2. Deploying To Heroku

To deploy the application to "Heroku":http://heroku.com/, simply run _heroku create_ :

{% highlight bash %}
$ heroku create
Creating evening-beach-14... done
Created http://evening-beach-14.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:evening-beach-14.git
Git remote heroku added
{% endhighlight %}

The _evening-beach-14_ part will vary depending on the name Heroku chooses for your application.

To push your newly created application to Heroku, do a _git push heroku master_ :

{% highlight bash %}
$ git push heroku master
Counting objects: 1669, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (629/629), done.
Writing objects: 100% (1669/1669), 382.36 KiB, done.
Total 1669 (delta 955), reused 1657 (delta 949)

       http://evening-beach-14.heroku.com deployed to Heroku

To git@heroku.com:evening-beach-14.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
{% endhighlight %}

Next, create the database on Heroku :

{% highlight bash %}
$ heroku rake db:setup
{% endhighlight %}

You should also install the free "SendGrid":http://sendgrid.com/ add-on for email delivery :

{% highlight bash %}
$ heroku addons:add sendgrid:free
{% endhighlight %}

Your application should now be available at "http://evening-beach-14.heroku.com/":http://evening-beach-14.heroku.com/ (substitute the domain you received from _git push heroku_ here).

Whenever you push changes to git, you can update heroku by doing _git push heroku_ again.

h2. Git hooks

CoffeeScript and Compass both require generated files to be saved when they're compiled - this causes a problem on Heroku because access to the filesystem is limited. There are various hacks to get around this by saving to the _tmp_ folder and re-routing requests, but I decided it was probably easiest to just add the generated files to git and deploy them normally.

To achieve this, I added a post-commit hook to the repository to generate these files whenever changes are committed. To add these, create the file _.git/hooks/pre-commit_ , make it executable, and add the following contents :

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh

compass compile
exec rake public/javascripts/application.js
jammit
{% endhighlight %}

The first two commands generate the CSS and Javascript respectively, and the 3rd command packages them up using Jammit. 

The _jammit_ command doesn’t seem to be working 100% reliably in the pre-commit hook for reasons I don't currently understand - if your changes aren't reflected on Heroku you may have to run the _jammit_ command by hand and re-commit. I hope to fix this problem in the near future, and any suggestions would be appreciated.

h2. Internationalization

_Rails Kitchen Sink_ is fully I18N-ready, but unfortunately the only translation is currently (i assume fairly badly) auto-generated-french from Google translate. If you'd like to contribute a translation, you can start by looking at the "translation files":http://recursive-design.com/code/p/rails-kitchen-sink/source/tree/master/config/locales and "static pages":http://recursive-design.com/code/p/rails-kitchen-sink/source/tree/master/app/views/pages. There's not a great deal of text to translate, so if anyone is feeling particularly generous and/or bored, additional translations would be very much appreciated! 

h2. Stylesheets

Stylesheets in the _public/stylesheets_ folder are automatically generated by compass, so any changes you make to these files will be lost. Instead, you should edit the _sass_ files in _app/stylesheets_.

When altering stylesheets during development, you should run _compass watch_ to make sure your changes are automatically compiled to _public/stylesheets_ :

{% highlight bash %}
$ compass watch
>>> Compass is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to Stop.
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Javascript

Similarly, _public/javascripts/application.js_ is automatically generated by the CoffeeScript compiler. Instead of editing it directly, edit _application/scripts/application.coffee_ instead. 

Unlike Compass, there is no need to run a _watch_ script for this file during development - it will automatically be compiled for you.

h2. Asset Packaging

JavaScript and CSS are automatically compressed and packaged for production with "Jammit":http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/. During development, the non-compressed versions will be served to speed things up. This packaging should be fairly transparent to you if you set up the git pre-commit hook described above - if you choose not to do this you will need to run the _jammit_ command manually before committing changes.

h2. Bug Reports

If you come across any problems, please "create a ticket":http://recursive-design.com/code/p/rails-kitchen-sink/issues/ and we'll try to get it fixed as soon as possible.
